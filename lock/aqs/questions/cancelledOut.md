# How does CANCELLED node move out the queue ?
In the [How does CANCELLED node come up ?](./questions/cancelledCameup.md) we have ready known that CANCELLED nodes come  
from two ways:
* thread held by the node is interrupted by other thread outside ——> thread wake up ——> set the node CANCCELED
* the node is generated by calling lock with timeout, once timeout running out  ——> thread wake up ——> set the node CANCCELED

Since the thread in the CANCCELED node don't need to compete for the State, how does the non-CANCCELED nodes avoid them ?
Or how does CANCELLED node move out the queue ?
